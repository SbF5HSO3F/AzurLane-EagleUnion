Using trade routes with the city-states to unite the city-states, combined with the power of the Eagle Union, New Jersey can crush all evil forces. New Jersey will effectively protect the Eagle Union from infringement, thereby maximizing the advantages of the Eagle Union civilization in the Science Victory. Of course, with the support of so many city-states, New Jersey did equally well in its diplomatic victories.</Text>

			<Text>USS New Jersey is the Iowa-class battleship No. 2 built by the United States Navy in the early years of World War II and the second ship of the United States Navy to be named after New Jersey. New Jersey has a well-known nickname, the "Garden State" – New Jersey does not have many gardens, but once prides itself on large farms. This did not praise New Jersey's rich agricultural output, but the ultimate purpose was proposed in 1876 to protest the New Yorkers in the north and the Pennsylvans in the west seizing the resources of the state's farms and asking the citizens to stand up and "defend their garden state", Abraham Browning, who was the state attorney general, called New Jersey the Garden State in his speech, saying that New Jersey was like a vat full of food, with open mouths at both ends, Pennsylvanians scooping up good food from one end and leaving the other to New Yorkers. Now this nickname has no political connotations, and as a state that straddles the two large urban agglomerations of New York and Philadelphia, New Jersey is indeed advantageous.</Text>

			<Text>Here we need to explain the composition of the US Pacific Fleet during World War II: when it comes to the US Pacific Fleet, everyone's first impression may be "powerful" and "meritorious". During World War II, the U.S. Navy's Pacific Fleet, under the command of Commander-in-Chief Admiral Nimitz, fought against the naval forces of an entire country in the old Japanese Empire from the western coastline of the United States, to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, to the Central Pacific Islands, the South Pacific and Australia, and finally to Southeast Asia and the Japanese mainland. The core sequence of this fleet, which confronted the Combined Fleet head-on in World War II, was the Third Fleet/Fifth Fleet, the 38/58th Task Force, dubbed the "Annihilation Fleet", which was officially the most elite main force of the fleet.</Text>

Although the most difficult moment of the US Navy in the Pacific had passed by then, the victory of the war still required the final blow of the righteous division, and New Jersey witnessed all this as the flagship of the fleet, all the way to the Gulf of Tonkin, until the American troops sent home ...</Text>

			<Text>New Jersey's flagship career during World War II was generally characterized by one thing - although it was the flagship of the fleet, New Jersey never avoided war. If battleships were needed to provide support, New Jersey would certainly not take care of the fleet commander on board the ships, accurately appearing in battle positions, or even at the forefront of the battlefield.</Text>

			<Text>During World War II, New Jersey participated in successive battles in the Marshall Islands and Kwajalein, serving as the flagship of the Fifth Fleet before attacking Truk Mooring, Palau and Wallay Atoll, briefly stepping down as the flagship of the fleet to support the landing in New Guinea, and finally participating in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. Fleet commanders rotated to serve as flagship of the Third Fleet, participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and supported the U.S. forces in retaking the Philippines. After stepping down as the flagship of the Third Fleet, he supported the attack on Iwo Jima, advanced to Okinawa, and eventually re-entered Tokyo Bay as the flagship of the Fifth Fleet. After World War II, the main force of the Pacific Fleet was replaced by the Seventh Fleet, and New Jersey unsurprisingly became the flagship of the Seventh Fleet, participating in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Lebanese Civil War, but it was Missouri and Wisconsin who did not participate in the Gulf War, and finally retired before the Gulf War. Now, New Jersey is moored as a museum ship in the Camden Harbor area of New Jersey, where the former New York shipyard is located - returning to the former shipbuilding industry town with such a naval tradition in New Jersey.</Text>

			<Text>The Iowa-class battleships were a class of fast battleships that the United States Navy began designing in 1938 and began construction in 1940, making them the last battleships and largest battleships of the United States Navy. They were the most well-known battleships of the Second World War, combining firepower and protection with high speed performance - of all the battleships built and commissioned, the Iowa class was the longest, the most powerful, and naturally the fastest. They were also the last battleships in the world to be decommissioned, and it was not until the 1990s that four Iowa class ships were decommissioned.</Text>

			<Text>During the "Naval Holiday" period, under the constraints of naval treaties, the United States successively built six cutting-edge treaty-type battleships, namely two North Carolina-class and four South Dakota-class. Their speed is around 27-28 knots. Based on the "Orange Plan" conceived by the U.S. military, in order to counter the heavy cruisers, battle cruisers and all potential high-speed combat ships of the Japanese Navy on the other side of the Pacific, and to provide escort and support for the fast aircraft carrier task force, the U.S. Navy needed to deploy a higher speed battleship. With Japan's withdrawal from the treaty in 1936 and the signing of the "upgrade clause" of the treaty in 1938, the standard displacement limit for new battleships was relaxed to 45,000 tons, and the design and construction of the new high-speed battleship envisaged by the US Navy gradually got on track.</Text>

			<Text>The Iowa class was built very quickly, and the first 2 ships entered service in 43. The lead ship Iowa was designed as a flagship, with a larger conning tower, and did not have a Bofors cannon on turret 2 for better views, which is one of the important symbols that distinguishes it from its other 3 sister ships. In addition, during the construction process, the bridge structure of each ship was different. The original design was an open-air bridge similar to the South Dakota-class one, which was changed to a curved enclosed bridge shortly after New Jersey was completed, and a more space-spaced square-headed bridge in Missouri and Wisconsin, and revised to this style in 1945 by Iowa and New Jersey.</Text>

In the 1980s, a large-scale modernization was also carried out, with the ability to launch missiles. It was retired from service in the 1990s and played a role as a museum.</Text>
