Although people don't know much about you, you'll soon be able to show people what makes you different – the huge caliber cannon is really powerful. Go ahead, crush the enemy's defenses with artillery fire, and you will make people realize the prestige of the Iowa class battleships again.</Text>

			<Text>Georgia, as the Iowa class battleship prototype solution IV, has a powerful firepower, which gives her a unique advantage in attacking cities and navies——— all units in Georgia have [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength bonuses when attacking area defense and navy, while long-range units and navies can also deal full damage to cities. Therefore, Georgia's naval strength is not bad, not to mention the blessing of strong unique units. Georgia needs to explore the surrounding area as soon as possible in the early stages of the game in order to accelerate its development with strong international trade routes and plantations, and then develop industrial zones to consolidate the advantages accumulated in the early stage. All this makes Georgia suitable for victory in conquest and victory in culture, and her strength in both areas cannot be underestimated.</Text>

			<Text>The Iowa class battleship prototype IV was only one of a series of proposals proposed during the demonstration of the Iowa class battleships in May 1938. Therefore, in history, the battleship Georgia was just an idea in people's minds (this idea is not necessarily called Georgia), and there was no corresponding ship built into service. The only places where she appears are World of Warships and Azur Lane.</Text>

			<Text>In World of Warships, the ship appeared in early game promotional images, but remained hidden. The model was relaunched on February 21, 2019, on the occasion of the 110th anniversary of the Great White Fleet's circumnavigation of the world. The difference is that the developers replaced her with three twin 457mm MKA turrets. It makes up for the regret that there is only MK6, and the overall weight can be basically unchanged. However, in the process of designing the Iowa class, the US Navy never considered the twin 457mm scheme, only the triple solution, which was an important reason why the design was overweight. The state of Georgia's hull in World of Warships is 1945. In "Azur Lane", Georgia appeared as the plan ship of the second phase of the linkage between "Azur Lane" and "World of Warships".</Text>

			<Text>This was one of a series of proposals proposed during the demonstration of the Iowa class battleships in May 1938, and was then listed as Option IV. The scheme was based on the South Dakota-class battleships, elongated the hull, switched to double chimneys. At the same time, the South Dakota-class thruster design was followed, so that the design speed could reach 33 knots. Three triple 406mm/45 MK6 turrets were planned, which were slightly shorter and lighter in tonnage than other 50-caliber 406mm guns of the same period, but lacked firepower. In fact, if the Iowa class ends up with the MK6 turret design, it will have no effect other than increasing the speed by 6 knots.</Text>
