			<Text>SG's new radar can be described as a magic weapon. With its blessing, Helena has a high diplomatic visibility, spies have a high success rate of operations, and enemy espionage activities in the country are vigorously suppressed. As a result, her unit has a wide field of view and can reduce the Combat Strength of adjacent enemies by a large [ICON_Strength]. Building a city on the coast, "Dream of Kura Gulf" will bring considerable output to it, making it a city of culture. Using intelligence superiority and broad vision to monitor the enemy's movements at all times, Helena's land will be untouched, and the peace brought will become a strong guarantee for Helena to achieve Culture victory and Science victory.</Text>

			<Text>USS Helena CL50 is the Brooklyn-class light cruiser No. 9 (St. Louis-class No. 2) of the United States Navy. The two ships of this class were originally Brooklyn-class ships No. 8 and No. 9, which were separately equipped with improved high-pressure boilers and higher firepower, so they were divided into separate classes. Construction began on December 9, 1936, and was launched at the New York Navy Yard on August 27, 1938, and the ceremony was presided over by the launch ceremony of Montana Senator Thomas M. Smith. Eleanor Carlisle Goger, granddaughter of J. Welch. It was commissioned on 18 September 1939 with its first captain being Captain Max A. B. Dermott. After her service, Helena was assigned to the Pacific Fleet and was attached to the 9th Cruiser Detachment under the command of Rear Admiral H. Fellacus Leary.</Text>

			<Text>The ship played a key role in the Battle of Cape Esperance and the Battle of Guadalcanal. And at the Battle of Kula Bay on July 6, 1943, Helena's radar picked up the Japanese formation, giving the fleet a head start. Helena and Honolulu, St. Louis shells very accurately hit the Japanese cover team belonging to the Niizuki, Ryoukaze, Tanikaze 3 destroyers, Niizuki was lost, Ryoukaze front main gun shot, machine gun ammunition box fire, the hull of a number of places were pierced; Tanikaze anchor chain compartment was hit by a bullet, fortunately did not explode, the food compartments into the water. But as Helena did not use flameless powder, the dazzling muzzle fire exposed herself. In the night, the two ships, Ryoukaze and Tanikaze, which were still able to fight, fired 16 torpedoes in unison, using the flash of her fire as an aiming point. 7 minutes later, she was struck by three torpedoes fired by the Japanese, first by one torpedo that hit the bow of the ship and snapped it off, and then by two torpedoes that hit the middle of the ship and caused the hull to rip apart, breaking it into two and sinking it in a very short period of time.</Text>

During the overhaul, the No. 3 ship Savannah modified four twin 127mm/38 Mk12 high-level dual-purpose guns in a layout similar to the St. Louis class, mounted on the Mk32 gun mount. But the rear superstructure still retains the characteristics of the first 7 Brooklyn-class ships.</Text>

			<Text>This class of ships is a product of the London Naval Treaty of 1930, according to which the United States also has a total of 30,000 tons of heavy cruisers and a total of three heavy cruisers, and strictly limits the construction and completion time of these three ships, so in fact cannot immediately form combat effectiveness. In order to cope with the expanding naval power of other countries, the United States had to turn to the construction of light cruisers equipped with 152mm, that is, 6-inch main guns, just at this time the Japanese Navy's topmost cruiser appeared, which far exceeded the performance of the old light cruisers and immediately became the benchmark of the British and American navies, and this class and the British city-class cruisers were also a response to the top class.</Text>

			<Text>The main gun of the Brooklyn class is five triple Mk.16 152mm/47 naval guns, which can fire up to 23,881m at 47.5 degrees elevation angle, and can fire 8-10 rounds per minute, a total of 120-150 shells per minute, and the firepower even exceeds that of the previous heavy cruiser's multi-turret spirit, and the secondary gun is eight single-mounted 127mm/25 anti-aircraft guns. In addition, the class pioneered the use of a flat-deck ship type, and changed the design of previous heavy cruisers to place aviation facilities in the center of the ship, moving them to the stern: this would reduce the chance of serious damage caused by aviation fuel fires, but also increase the probability of aviation facilities being damaged by waves. This ship design has been used in subsequent cruisers such as the Cleveland class and the Baltimore class. Thus, the Brooklyn class is a landmark in the history of American cruiser construction.</Text>
